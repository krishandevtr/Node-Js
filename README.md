# ðŸ’¾ Node.js Streams, Buffers & File System Challenge

This challenge focus of node js core concepts such as js file system (`fs`), Buffers, and Streams. 

Each topic  focuses on one or more key concepts with increasing complexity.

---

## ðŸ“… Topic-01: Read a Text File

### âœ… Task:
- Read a `.txt` file using `fs.readFile`.
- Log its content to the console.



---

## ðŸ“… Topic-02:  Write to a Text File

### âœ… Task:
- Write a string to `output.txt` using `fs.writeFile`.

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus:
- Append a timestamp every time you run the script.

---

## ðŸ“… Topic-03: Buffers Basics

### âœ… Task:
- Create a `Buffer` from a string.
- Log the content and length.



---

## ðŸ“… Topic-04: Copy with Streams

### âœ… Task:
- Use `fs.createReadStream()` and `fs.createWriteStream()` to copy a large `.txt` file.



---

## ðŸ“… Topic-05: Transform Stream (Uppercase)

### âœ… Task:
- Create a custom `Transform` stream that converts incoming text to uppercase.
- Pipe input â†’ transform â†’ output.

---

## ðŸ“… Topic-07:  Line-by-Line Stream

### âœ… Task:
- Use `readline` and `fs.createReadStream()` to process a large log file line by line.

---

## ðŸ“… Topic-08:  Track File Copy Progress

### âœ… Task:
- Log number of bytes written as a stream copies a file.



---

## Topic-09: HTTP File Streaming Server

### âœ… Task:
- Build a Node.js HTTP server that streams a `.txt` or video file using `createReadStream()`.

---

## ðŸ“… Topic-10: CSV Parser Stream

### âœ… Task:
- Stream and parse a `.csv` file line-by-line into an array of objects.



---

## ðŸ“… Topic-12: Busboy File Upload (No Multer)

### âœ… Task:
- Create a `POST` endpoint that streams file uploads to disk using **Busboy**.



---

## ðŸ“…Topic-13: Custom Buffer Pool

### âœ… Task:
- Implement a buffer pooling system to simulate memory management in high-performance apps.

---

## ðŸ“… Topic-14: Throttle Read Stream (Backpressure)

### âœ… Task:
- Create a stream that emits data slowly (simulating backpressure).
- Use `.pause()` and `.resume()` methods.

---





---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Master `fs`, streams, buffers, backpressure, and file handling for real-world use cases like:
- File uploads
- Large file processing
- Video streaming
- Efficient memory usage

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Used

- Node.js (fs, stream, readline, http, buffer)
- Busboy
- MongoDB (optional bonus)
