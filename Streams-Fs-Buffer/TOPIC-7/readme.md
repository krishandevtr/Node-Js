# Assignment 7 ‚Äì Data Split and Count (Node.js Simulation of COBOL Batch Processing)

## üî∞ Introduction

This assignment simulates a COBOL batch program in **Node.js**, mimicking a legacy **mainframe system** used in an insurance company. It is part of a larger processing system that handles **insurance claims**.

The objective is to split **valid claim records** into two separate files (`REPAIR` and `REPLACE`) based on the **Claim Type** and generate a detailed **report** showing statistics and totals.

## üóÉÔ∏è Input File Layout

The program processes the valid data file:  
`DataSet.txt`

Each record has fixed-width fields:

| Field Name       | Position    | COBOL PIC      | Description                      |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Policy Number    | 1 ‚Äì 10      | X(10)          | Unique policy number             |
| Customer Name    | 11 ‚Äì 30     | X(20)          | Name of the policyholder         |
| Product Code     | 31 ‚Äì 33     | X(3)           | Appliance code                   |
| Claim Type       | 34 ‚Äì 40     | X(7)           | `REPAIR` or `REPLACE`            |
| Amount           | 41 ‚Äì 46     | 9(4)V99        | Amount claimed (decimal)         |
| Justification    | 47 ‚Äì 76     | X(30)          | Reason for the claim             |

## üìÇ Output Files

- `A7.REPAIR.DAT` ‚Äì All `REPAIR` records (same layout as input)
- `A7.REPLACE.DAT` ‚Äì All `REPLACE` records (same layout as input)
- `A7.RPT.OUT` ‚Äì A summary report with totals and analysis

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Rules

1. **Split Records by Claim Type**:
   - If `Claim Type` is `REPAIR` ‚Üí Write to `A7.REPAIR.DAT`
   - If `Claim Type` is `REPLACE` ‚Üí Write to `A7.REPLACE.DAT`

2. **Report Generation**:
   - For `REPAIR`:
     - Total number of REPAIR records
     - Total REPAIR amount
     - Record count and amount per **Product Code**
   - For `REPLACE`:
     - Total number of REPLACE records
     - Total REPLACE amount
     - Record count and amount per **Product Code**
     - % and number of claims per **Region**
   - **Grand Total** for all claims (REPAIR + REPLACE)

## üìÑ Report Requirements

- Include all of the above stats in a clear, formatted summary.
- Your layout design is flexible but must be clean and readable.

## üìÅ Folder/File Naming Convention

Replace `YYY` with the **last three letters** of your mainframe ID.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `A7SPLIT` | COBOL or Node.js split logic program |
| `A7CL`    | Compile JCL (used in COBOL env) |
| `A7R`     | Run JCL (used in COBOL env) |
| `A7.REPAIR.DAT` | REPAIR data output |
| `A7.REPLACE.DAT` | REPLACE data output |
| `A7.RPT.OUT` | Final output report file |

## üìå Notes

- No error checking is needed (assume input data is already validated).
- You are encouraged to simulate COBOL logic in **Node.js** for batch file processing.

---

## üß† Tip for Development

- Use `fs.createReadStream()` and `readline` to process large files line-by-line.
- Use `fs.writeFileSync()` or `fs.createWriteStream()` to split records into files.
- Create a reusable function to calculate totals and format reports.
